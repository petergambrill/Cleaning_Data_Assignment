#R script

There is only one R script in this repo "run_analysis.R".

This script will download data from an experiment involving 30 volunteers who  wore activity trackers while performing six activities.

It will then tidy up the data and produce two datasets 

1. Containing all observations for variables which report the mean or standard deviation of measurements recorded by the activty trackers

2. Collapses the above dataset to provide the average value of each varaible per individual.
